## 📌 Project Overview
Pet Shop Delivery Platform is a full-stack web application designed to manage an entire pet store ordering and delivery workflow in a professional and organized way.  
The system includes **three main roles**:

✅ **Admin**  
✅ **Captain (Delivery Driver)**  
✅ **Customer**

The platform allows customers to **browse products**, **place orders**, and **track deliveries live on a map**, while admins manage everything from a dashboard and assign orders to captains who can communicate with customers and update delivery status in real time.

---

## 🎯 Why I Built This Project
This project was built to simulate a real production-level delivery system similar to **Talabat** and modern delivery platforms.  
The goal was to practice advanced full-stack concepts such as:

- Role-based dashboards  
- Real-time notifications  
- Order assignment workflows  
- Live delivery tracking  
- Captain communication system  
- Database design and scalable architecture

## 🧩 Main Features

### 👨‍💼 Admin Dashboard
The admin has full control over the system through a central dashboard that allows:

✅ Manage customers and captains  
✅ Create and assign delivery orders to captains  
✅ Track order statuses in real time  
✅ View full order history and order details  
✅ Monitor captain performance and activity  
✅ Send system notifications  

📢 **Example of real-time notifications inside the admin panel**
- You have assigned **Order 7** to Captain **Ahmed**  
- Captain Ahmed **accepted** Order 7  
- Captain Ahmed **rejected** Order 7

Each captain has their own dashboard that supports:

✅ Viewing assigned orders with full customer details
